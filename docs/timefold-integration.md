# Timefold.ai Integration

## Overview
This document outlines the integration plan for Timefold.ai's field service routing model into the Caire platform's scheduling system.

## Integration Components

### 1. API Client Setup
- Create a dedicated Timefold API client in `src/lib/timefold/`
- Implement authentication and request handling
- Set up environment variables for API keys and endpoints

### 2. Solver Configuration
- Define constraint rules based on home care requirements:
  - Travel time minimization
  - Staff skill matching
  - Time window adherence
  - Break scheduling
  - Client preferences
  - Care continuity

### 3. Data Models
```typescript
type Visit = {
  id: string;
  clientId: string;
  requiredSkills: string[];
  timeWindow: {
    start: string;
    end: string;
  };
  duration: number;
  location: {
    lat: number;
    lng: number;
  };
};

type Staff = {
  id: string;
  skills: string[];
  workingHours: {
    start: string;
    end: string;
  };
  breaks: {
    start: string;
    duration: number;
  }[];
};

type SolverConfig = {
  constraintProviderClass: string;
  termination: {
    spentLimit: string;
  };
  environmentMode: string;
};
```

### 4. Integration Points
1. **Schedule Creation**
   - Convert Caire data model to Timefold format
   - Submit optimization request
   - Handle solver status updates

2. **Real-time Updates**
   - Implement webhook handlers for solver events
   - Update UI with optimization progress
   - Handle solution updates

3. **Constraint Management**
   - Expose constraint weights in UI
   - Allow real-time constraint adjustments
   - Visualize impact of constraint changes

### 5. Error Handling
- Implement retry mechanisms
- Handle API rate limits
- Log solver failures
- Provide fallback scheduling options

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Integration
- [x] Set up API client
- [ ] Implement data model conversion
- [ ] Create basic solver configuration
- [ ] Test with sample dataset

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- [ ] Add real-time optimization
- [ ] Implement constraint management UI
- [ ] Add progress visualization
- [ ] Integrate with existing schedule views

### Phase 3: Production Readiness
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Implement monitoring
- [ ] Add performance optimizations
- [ ] Complete documentation

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for data conversion
2. Integration tests with Timefold API
3. Performance testing with large datasets
4. UI testing for constraint management
5. End-to-end scheduling workflow tests

## Monitoring
- Track solver performance metrics
- Monitor API usage and limits
- Log optimization statistics
- Track constraint satisfaction levels

## Security Considerations
- Secure API key storage
- Data encryption in transit
- Access control for constraint management
- Audit logging for schedule changes
