# Features Directory

## Current Status - Prototype Phase

This directory currently contains UI prototype pages and mock-ups. No business logic or database integration is implemented yet.

### Current Structure

- `analytics/` - Analytics UI mock-ups
- `auth/` - Authentication flow mock-ups
- `billing/` - Billing interface mock-ups
- `clients/` - Client management UI mock-ups
- `dashboard/` - Dashboard layout and KPI mock-ups
- `employees/` - Employee management UI mock-ups
- `landing/` - Landing page components
- `schedule/` - Schedule view mock-ups
- `settings/` - Settings interface mock-ups

## Business Logic Implementation

### Core Business Logic

Core business logic should be implemented in the `src/lib/services` directory, not in the features directory. Each feature will have a corresponding service:

```
src/lib/services/
├── analytics/
│   └── analytics-service.ts    # Analytics business logic
├── scheduling/
│   └── scheduling-service.ts   # Scheduling algorithms and logic
├── employees/
│   └── employee-service.ts     # Employee management logic
└── clients/
    └── client-service.ts       # Client management logic
```

### Feature-Specific Logic

Features directory should only contain:

1. UI Components and their local state
2. Server Actions for form handling
3. Data fetching hooks that call services
4. Feature-specific types and interfaces
5. UI-related utilities

Example of separation:

```typescript
// src/lib/services/scheduling/scheduling-service.ts
export class SchedulingService {
  async optimizeSchedule(params: ScheduleParams): Promise<Schedule> {
    // Core business logic for schedule optimization
  }
}

// src/features/schedule/components/ScheduleForm.tsx
export async function createSchedule(data: FormData) {
  "use server";
  const schedulingService = new SchedulingService();
  return schedulingService.optimizeSchedule({
    // Form data processing
  });
}
```

## Future Implementation Guidelines

When implementing business logic and database integration, each feature will be expanded to include:

```
feature-name/
├── components/     # Feature-specific components
├── hooks/         # Feature-specific hooks
├── utils/         # Feature-specific utilities
├── types/         # TypeScript types and interfaces
└── index.ts       # Public API exports
```

### Implementation Checklist

1. [ ] Add proper TypeScript types for data models
2. [ ] Implement core business logic in services
3. [ ] Create server actions for data mutations
4. [ ] Add error handling and loading states
5. [ ] Integrate with database via services
6. [ ] Add proper form validation
7. [ ] Implement proper auth checks
8. [ ] Add unit and integration tests

### Best Practices for Implementation

- Keep features isolated and self-contained
- Use React Server Components where possible
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading and error states
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Document complex business logic
- Write comprehensive tests

This document will be updated as we progress from prototype to full implementation.

## Directory Structure

- `analytics/` - Analytics and reporting features
- `auth/` - Authentication and authorization features
- `billing/` - Billing and subscription management
- `clients/` - Client management features
- `dashboard/` - Dashboard and overview features
- `employees/` - Employee management features
- `landing/` - Landing page components
- `schedule/` - Scheduling and planning features
- `settings/` - Application and organization settings

## Feature Organization

Each feature directory should follow this structure:

```
feature-name/
├── components/     # Feature-specific components
├── hooks/         # Feature-specific hooks
├── utils/         # Feature-specific utilities
├── types/         # TypeScript types and interfaces
└── index.ts       # Public API exports
```

## Best Practices

### Code Organization

- Keep features isolated and self-contained
- Minimize cross-feature dependencies
- Use proper TypeScript types
- Follow single responsibility principle
- Document complex business logic
- Add proper error handling

### State Management

- Use React Server Components where possible
- Implement proper loading states
- Handle error states gracefully
- Use proper data fetching patterns
- Follow Next.js 14+ best practices

### Testing

- Write unit tests for complex logic
- Test critical user flows
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error scenarios
- Verify accessibility

### Documentation

- Document complex business rules
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep documentation up to date
- Include usage examples
- Document any required setup

## Example Feature Structure

```
schedule/
├── components/
│   ├── Calendar.tsx
│   ├── ScheduleGrid.tsx
│   └── TimeSlotPicker.tsx
├── hooks/
│   ├── useSchedule.ts
│   └── useTimeSlots.ts
├── utils/
│   ├── date-helpers.ts
│   └── schedule-validators.ts
├── types/
│   └── index.ts
└── index.ts
```

## Adding New Features

1. Create a new directory under `features/`
2. Follow the standard feature structure
3. Keep the feature self-contained
4. Document the feature's purpose and usage
5. Add proper tests and error handling
6. Update this README if needed
